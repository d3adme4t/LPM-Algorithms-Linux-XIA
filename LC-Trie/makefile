# The name of our program:
PROGRAM= lctrie

# These are our C source files:
SRCS= qsort.c build_table.c destroy_table.c lookup.c main.c Good_32bit_Rand.c

# The name of the C-compiler we want to use:
CC= gcc

# The flags (options) that the C-compiler needs:
#CFLAGS = -O4            # optimization
CFLAGS = -g	      # debugging, warnings
#CFLAGS = -a           # tcov, profiling, works only with cc
#CFLAGS = -xpg          # gprof, works only with cc

# Names of libraries we need to link with our program:
LDLIBS= -lm

# Object files are derived from the sources, with .c replaced by .o
OBJECTS = ${SRCS:%.c=%.o}

# The first target, the name of our program:
${PROGRAM}: $(OBJECTS)
	$(LINK.c) -o $@ $(OBJECTS) $(LDLIBS)

# To remove generated object files:
clean:
	-rm -f ${OBJECTS}
